						<li>"Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy"<br> - Aristotle

						<li>"I would just say don't even get started if you're just gonna do some mediocre shit.  'Cause there's so much of that.  Don't do it just to make noise.  There's too much noise.  Give me something amazing.  Give me something new.  Give me something I haven't seen before in a way I haven't seen it.  Let me feel something.  Find some kind of magic.  Go towards something that's inexplicable.  Give it to me.  Give me something that's aggressive and gnarly.  Chew up the world; come at it from some other place.  But just don't, don't give me the same shit over and over again because I don't want it."<br> - Harmony Korine</li>
